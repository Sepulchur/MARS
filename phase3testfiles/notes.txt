1. p3t_assignments_complex , operations out of order propably doesnt matter (fixed , but temp counter goes further than in okeanos)
2. p3t_assignments_objects , line 7 causes syntax error removing the parenthesis fixes it, order of arguements not the same as okeanos , extra TABLE_GET_ELEM in okeanos for every obj .
3. p3t_assignments_simple , assigns out of order , some are using wrong elements (px assign a a )(done)
4. p3t_basic_expr , same as above (done)
5. p3t_calls , param nil not needed(done)
6. p3t_funcdecl , missing a jump after return , jump labels not correct (done , first jumps different than okeanos , ours seem more correct ?)

all backpatch 
both flowcontrol
relational

                        changes :

    parse.y

funcdef (for jump after return)
returnstmt (for jump after return)

    quad.c

make_call (removed param nil)
